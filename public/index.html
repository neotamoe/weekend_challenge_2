<!--  The logic for the calculator needs to be housed on the Server, where the client
side will take in the values (in 2 input text fields) and the type of mathematical
operation (selected using a button on the DOM). Each of the numerical values and
type of mathematical operation will be bundled up in an object and then sent to
the server via a POST. So when the object is sent, it should look something
like this: { x: 3, y: 4, type: Add }

Once the server receives it, build out logic to compute the numbers in 1 of 4
different ways. The server should be able to handle Addition, Subtraction,
Multiplication, and Division. Once the calculation is complete, it should be sent
back down to the client side app where it should be displayed on the DOM.

Finally, build a 'clear' button that resets the whole experience.-->

<!--HARD MODE:
Convert the input fields for the two values to Buttons. So the experience would
allow the user to click on a numerical button, then a mathematical operation,
then a numerical button again. Then have an equal button that sends all of the
information to the server.-->

<!--PRO MODE:
Create a delay from when the client receives the response from the Server, and
when the calculation is actually displayed on the DOM. The delay should be
3 seconds. During that delay, show information that says 'computing' until the
3 second delay has finished, then remove the 'computing' message while showing
the calculation.  -->
